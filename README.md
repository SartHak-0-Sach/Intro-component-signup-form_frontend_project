## Overview

### The challenge

Enroll in our coding course with ease using the Intro Component Signup Form! 

This signup component allows users to-
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size 
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page 
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if any input field is empty or if the email address is not formatted correctly.

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/Intro-component-signup-form_frontend_project.git
    ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Run the project using a live server extension or deploy it using Netlify, Vercel, or another web hosting and deployment service.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

This project taught me how to use input validation using JavaScript which was implemented to validate first name, last name and email. Following snippet is one good example of the same-

```js
function validateFirstName(firstname) {
  let regex = /^[\w'\-,.][^0-9_!¬°?√∑?¬ø/\\+=@#$%ÀÜ&*(){}|~<>;:[\]]{2,}$/;

  if (regex.test(firstname) === true) {
    nameerror.style.visibility = "hidden";
    erroricon1.style.visibility = "hidden";
  } else {
    nameerror.style.visibility = "visible";
    erroricon1.style.visibility = "visible";
    inputFirstName.style.border = "1px solid Red";
  }
}

function validateLasttName(lastname) {
  let regex = /^[\w'\-,.][^0-9_!¬°?√∑?¬ø/\\+=@#$%ÀÜ&*(){}|~<>;:[\]]{2,}$/;

  if (regex.test(lastname) === true) {
    lastnameerror.style.visibility = "hidden";
    erroricon2.style.visibility = "hidden";
  } else {
    lastnameerror.style.visibility = "visible";
    erroricon2.style.visibility = "visible";
    inputLastName.style.border = "1px solid Red";
  }
}
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.

### Useful resources
